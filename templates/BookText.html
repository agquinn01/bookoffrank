<p>Unexpected Catharsis</p>
<p>It had been 15 years since I’d talked to him… maybe a few calls here and there… taking care of papers, admin, things like that. Not the type of relationship I wanted to have… not the type of relationship I used to have. But that’s the way it was. That’s the way it’s been… and now, I can’t go back and change any of that. I’m stuck with the memory of, well, of having no memory of the last 15 years… that is to say, we shared nothing, made no new memories. It was all blank space in terms of us. There was very little there. When I heard he’d died, when I heard he had his stroke, I couldn’t move. I froze, emotionless, in shock, and carried on what I was doing. I wanted to cry, to break down right there and then, but I couldn’t. First, I was stuck at work, there’s the ever-present pressure to be on your game, to be strong and in charge, to not break down in front of the young ones. Second I suddenly felt completely out of control of what was happening inside me, like being stranded in a lifeboat amidst a huge ocean, turbulent and dark, with waves the size of foothills barreling towards me from every direction. It was a mix of heartbreak, grief, anger, frustration, and resentment… betrayed by 15 years of silence.</p>
<p>“Frank… Frank… FRANK!” It was Amanda. She and I had been working on a pharmaceuticals account for months. We were in the middle of preparing for a pitch tomorrow and now this. “Everything okay?” She asked? We usually didn’t get too personal at work. There was that fine line, but this… this was different. I wanted to tell her, to let her know what was going on. I guess the perfect storm raging on the inside had left me dazed and stone-faced on the exterior.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a family emergency.”</p>
<p>“Everything okay?”</p>
<p>“No. Not really.”</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I know.”</p>
<p>“So that’s it for today? Cancel tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Can you do it on your own?”</p>
<p>“I can try.”</p>
<p>“This really isn’t ideal,” I tried to keep it professional “but I’ve got to go.”</p>
<p>“Shit. It’s bad.”</p>
<p>“It’s my father.”</p>
<p>She looked at me and I could see her expression change. I must have let something slip. There was no good poker face for this.</p>
<p>“Alright. Go. I’ve got this. Don’t worry about anything. Just go. I’ll let HR know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>I got out as fast as I could avoiding small talk in the halls, praying for the empty elevator that took an eternity to arrive as the past came flooding back, image by image.</p>
<p>The ride to the hospital was a blur. He had been in a coma and there was little to do there but wait. It was silence, tears, hugs between my sister and I, his two kids. Her niece Matilda was there. An odd girl that I never really understood, but tried to over the years. She felt distant often, but today, she was warm. There was little else to be. We waited for hours but he was slipping away slowly.</p>
<p>The nurses came and went, and mostly left us alone. There was just one thing. His bunny.</p>

<p>“What else is there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Frank”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“That memory, I don’t know where it is.”</p>
<p>“The fuck are you talking about? Find, the memory. Search for the damn memory!”</p>
<p>“It’s not in the memory of the pilot.”</p>
<p>“Play it again. Play it again!”</p>
<p>“I’m trying but I can’t. I don’t know where it came from. It was in my imagination.”</p>
<p>“Listen. Toki. Bunny. That thing you just did. Do it again.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to say. I can’t.”</p>
<p>No? He can’t play it again? There was only one person I knew who knew anything about this stuff. Matilda.</p>
<p>I called my sister. They were home. I put the bunny in his box and we made our way to their place, subway line by subway line. (cameras) I picked up some pastries and coffee before going in. Didn’t want to be too suspicious. It was still early. She wasn’t up. My sister hadn’t told her. We sat at the kitchen table, ate and drank, tried not to lose it completely. There was too much going on right now. I wanted to explode. To rip the head clean off the bunny, roll it across the table to my sister and say ‘Here. It’s the last place he exists.’ But that would have ruined breakfast. There was no way this little bunny didn’t know what it had shown me. There’s no way that it didn’t know what was going on in its own brain. Matilda was the first person who would know. She got up finally, and came into the kitchen where she stopped upon seeing me. She looked to her mother and could see on her face that something had happened. She didn’t seem surprised, but knowing her own grief was nothing compared to what her mother was going through, took a step forward and held her. My sister and niece stayed like that as I listened to the clock tick. My sister left my niece there with me as she went to the bathroom to compose herself.</p>
<p>“Matilda”</p>
<p>“Uncle Frank?”</p>
<p>“I need to ask you a serious question.”</p>
<p>“How do you get the memory out of one of these things?” I opened the box and Toki stood up.</p>
<p>“You brought that here? Get it out.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. You have to help me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not helping you with that. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s the devil, but it’s got… it’s got a lot of Pop Pop’s memory on there and I want to get it off.”</p>
<p>“Well you can’t just plug it in. Those things don’t do that. It’s a <a href="/item10">Calico</a> thing.”</p>
<p>“Calico. The drug company.”</p>
<p>“it’s recording everything we are saying and doing. Frank. Put it away. I can’t help you. And I’m not talking to you in front of it. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“Wait.” I grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into the side hallway. “You have to help me get this memory out of its head. It’s got Pop Pop in there. The last 15 years. It played it for me.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean it played it for you?”</p>
<p>“Light shot out of its eyes and it played the memory back for me. But it can’t do it again. Says it’s trapped inside the bunny’s brain. Not the pilot. You’ve got to know something about this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not uncommon. Those things are evil. They enslave the bunny, and take it over. You think it’s a bunny but it’s not. There have been cases, though, of the bunny keeping memories, and interrupting the system, the pilot. Listen. How bad do you want the memory off that bunny?”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad, like you’d pay someone to get the memory off?”</p>
<p>“I’m not paying you. You’re my niece.”</p>
<p>“Not me. But I know someone.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“I’m not speaking with that thing in the house.”</p>
<p>“Yes, fine. Let’s just do it. I have to return the damn thing.”</p>
<p>“Alright. You want to see how it’s done?”</p>
<p>“How what’s done?”</p>
<p>“How to keep that devil spy from intercepting my message?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care… yes… show me”</p>
<p>She left, and returned from her room with a small, black phone. This is an encrypted phone. It’s time you learnt how this works. Go ahead. Send.</p>

	<p>The sun was coming down heavy now. It was present. A constant reminder that this day would not stop, would not pause, would not go any other way but forward. I wanted to pause it, to hold time in a vice and get my bearings but it doesn’t work that way. The river goes where the river goes. When you’re in it, you go where the river goes. I thought of holding the waters back, finding an eddy to where I could catch my breath and plan. It was right there in front of me. The memory. That frail and fragile creature, gatekeeper to lost time, was a heartbeat away from extinction. Now, with Matilda in the picture, it made things more complex, I could only hope that we weren’t heading into a disaster. She was making plans with people I didn’t know, about something I couldn’t comprehend, that held the key to something I’d missed. One by one, the questions came. They couldn’t be tamed by the sunlight, or calmed with words. They were ever present.</p>
<p>I don’t like questions. They’re the kind of thing I try to avoid. I try to answer questions, at least to the people that need to be buying. I try to eliminate questions, to make it all seem okay. And usually it is. The questions are the things that get me down. I want to turn questions into emotion, angst into reassurance. And, now. I had none. I wanted to be able to leap from my own skin, rise above the room, fly out from where we were, from this little apartment, pull apart the day and put the pieces back together my way. (asop rock)</p>
<p>“Here. We go here.” Matilda returned with a hand drawn set of instructions. We were to go meet someone.</p>
<p>“We? Now?”</p>
<p>“Do you want it or not?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. We’ve just got to have a good lie to tell your mother.” Lies, are better than when they’re wrapped in truth. I’d just be dropping her off on my way out. She bought it. We embraced.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the coffee and pastries.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to head to the hospital to take care of everything. Will you be there?”</p>
<p>“After I take care of this little guy. George will be there. Will you be alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It just happened too quick.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be there later, just call.”</p>
<p>I stuffed the bunny in the box and we headed to the elevators.</p>
<p>“There’s no guarantee you know.” Matilda was trying to reassure me.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Do you…” She cut me off. She wouldn’t speak anymore in front of the bunny.</p>
<p>The light hurt my eyes, and the sleeplessness was starting to sink in, mixed with coffee, that strange sense of timelessness, of being on a different clock. The world moved around, and I started to feel like I was in that eddy after all. It was autopilot from there. The train. The transfers, waiting. We stopped and got food for the bunny. Rabbit food, plus some extra protein powder to keep his little brain functioning properly.</p>

<code>We got off down where the markets were, busy, bustling, crowded. The market was hot, the smell of cumin and curry, fried dumplings and spice. He’d be there. I couldn’t talk to her. She went ahead, pushing her way through the crowd, leading us left, right, under canopies. I couldn’t talk to her through all the nose and chaos nor would she let me If I tried. I noticed her for the first time. She was smart. From what my sister told me, she did well in school, but it was her other life that got her into trouble. She was partly an activist. Fighting against… well, against me really… against what I did. And I was starting not to</code>
