<p>“What else is there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Frank”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“That memory, I don’t know where it is.”</p>
<p>“The fuck are you talking about? Find, the memory. Search for the damn memory!”</p>
<p>“It’s not in the memory of the pilot.”</p>
<p>“Play it again. Play it again!”</p>
<p>“I’m trying but I can’t. I don’t know where it came from. It was in my imagination.”</p>
<p>“Listen. Toki. Bunny. That thing you just did. Do it again.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to say. I can’t.”</p>
<p>No? He can’t play it again? There was only one person I knew who knew anything about this stuff. Matilda.</p>
<p>I called my sister. They were home. I put the bunny in his box and we made our way to their place, subway line by subway line. (cameras) I picked up some pastries and coffee before going in. Didn’t want to be too suspicious. It was still early. She wasn’t up. My sister hadn’t told her. We sat at the kitchen table, ate and drank, tried not to lose it completely. There was too much going on right now. I wanted to explode. To rip the head clean off the bunny, roll it across the table to my sister and say ‘Here. It’s the last place he exists.’ But that would have ruined breakfast. There was no way this little bunny didn’t know what it had shown me. There’s no way that it didn’t know what was going on in its own brain. Matilda was the first person who would know. She got up finally, and came into the kitchen where she stopped upon seeing me. She looked to her mother and could see on her face that something had happened. She didn’t seem surprised, but knowing her own grief was nothing compared to what her mother was going through, took a step forward and held her. My sister and niece stayed like that as I listened to the clock tick. My sister left my niece there with me as she went to the bathroom to compose herself.</p>
<p>“Matilda”</p>
<p>“Uncle Frank?”</p>
<p>“I need to ask you a serious question.”</p>
<p>“How do you get the memory out of one of these things?” I opened the box and Toki stood up.</p>
<p>“You brought that here? Get it out.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. You have to help me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not helping you with that. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s the devil, but it’s got… it’s got a lot of Pop Pop’s memory on there and I want to get it off.”</p>
<p>“Well you can’t just plug it in. Those things don’t do that. It’s a <a href="/item10">Calico</a> thing.”</p>
<p>“Calico. The drug company.”</p>
<p>“it’s recording everything we are saying and doing. Frank. Put it away. I can’t help you. And I’m not talking to you in front of it. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“Wait.” I grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into the side hallway. “You have to help me get this memory out of its head. It’s got Pop Pop in there. The last 15 years. It played it for me.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean it played it for you?”</p>
<p>“Light shot out of its eyes and it played the memory back for me. But it can’t do it again. Says it’s trapped inside the bunny’s brain. Not the pilot. You’ve got to know something about this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not uncommon. Those things are evil. They enslave the bunny, and take it over. You think it’s a bunny but it’s not. There have been cases, though, of the bunny keeping memories, and interrupting the system, the pilot. Listen. How bad do you want the memory off that bunny?”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad, like you’d pay someone to get the memory off?”</p>
<p>“I’m not paying you. You’re my niece.”</p>
<p>“Not me. But I know someone.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“I’m not speaking with that thing in the house.”</p>
<p>“Yes, fine. Let’s just do it. I have to return the damn thing.”</p>
<p>“Alright. You want to see how it’s done?”</p>
<p>“How what’s done?”</p>
<p>“How to keep that devil spy from intercepting my message?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care… yes… show me”</p>
<p>She left, and returned from her room with a small, black phone. This is an encrypted phone. It’s time you learnt how this works. Go ahead. Send.</p>
