<p>Unexpected Catharsis</p>
<p>It had been 15 years since I’d talked to him… maybe a few calls here and there… taking care of papers, admin, things like that. Not the type of relationship I wanted to have… not the type of relationship I used to have. But that’s the way it was. That’s the way it’s been… and now, I can’t go back and change any of that. I’m stuck with the memory of, well, of having no memory of the last 15 years… that is to say, we shared nothing, made no new memories. It was all blank space in terms of us. There was very little there. When I heard he’d died, when I heard he had his stroke, I couldn’t move. I froze, emotionless, in shock, and carried on what I was doing. I wanted to cry, to break down right there and then, but I couldn’t. First, I was stuck at work, there’s the ever-present pressure to be on your game, to be strong and in charge, to not break down in front of the young ones. Second I suddenly felt completely out of control of what was happening inside me, like being stranded in a lifeboat amidst a huge ocean, turbulent and dark, with waves the size of foothills barreling towards me from every direction. It was a mix of heartbreak, grief, anger, frustration, and resentment… betrayed by 15 years of silence.</p>
<p>“Frank… Frank… FRANK!” It was Amanda. She and I had been working on a pharmaceuticals account for months. We were in the middle of preparing for a pitch tomorrow and now this. “Everything okay?” She asked? We usually didn’t get too personal at work. There was that fine line, but this… this was different. I wanted to tell her, to let her know what was going on. I guess the perfect storm raging on the inside had left me dazed and stone-faced on the exterior.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a family emergency.”</p>
<p>“Everything okay?”</p>
<p>“No. Not really.”</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I know.”</p>
<p>“So that’s it for today? Cancel tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Can you do it on your own?”</p>
<p>“I can try.”</p>
<p>“This really isn’t ideal,” I tried to keep it professional “but I’ve got to go.”</p>
<p>“Shit. It’s bad.”</p>
<p>“It’s my father.”</p>
<p>She looked at me and I could see her expression change. I must have let something slip. There was no good poker face for this.</p>
<p>“Alright. Go. I’ve got this. Don’t worry about anything. Just go. I’ll let HR know what’s going on.”</p>
<p>I got out as fast as I could avoiding small talk in the halls, praying for the empty elevator that took an eternity to arrive as the past came flooding back, image by image.</p>
<p>The ride to the hospital was a blur. He had been in a coma and there was little to do there but wait. It was silence, tears, hugs between my sister and I, his two kids. Her niece Matilda was there. An odd girl that I never really understood, but tried to over the years. She felt distant often, but today, she was warm. There was little else to be. We waited for hours but he was slipping away slowly.</p>
<p>The nurses came and went, and mostly left us alone. There was just one thing. His bunny.</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="3">
<p>“What else is there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Frank”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“That memory, I don’t know where it is.”</p>
<p>“The fuck are you talking about? Find, the memory. Search for the damn memory!”</p>
<p>“It’s not in the memory of the pilot.”</p>
<p>“Play it again. Play it again!”</p>
<p>“I’m trying but I can’t. I don’t know where it came from. It was in my imagination.”</p>
<p>“Listen. Toki. Bunny. That thing you just did. Do it again.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to say. I can’t.”</p>
<p>No? He can’t play it again? There was only one person I knew who knew anything about this stuff. Matilda.</p>
<p>I called my sister. They were home. I put the bunny in his box and we made our way to their place, subway line by subway line. (cameras) I picked up some pastries and coffee before going in. Didn’t want to be too suspicious. It was still early. She wasn’t up. My sister hadn’t told her. We sat at the kitchen table, ate and drank, tried not to lose it completely. There was too much going on right now. I wanted to explode. To rip the head clean off the bunny, roll it across the table to my sister and say ‘Here. It’s the last place he exists.’ But that would have ruined breakfast. There was no way this little bunny didn’t know what it had shown me. There’s no way that it didn’t know what was going on in its own brain. Matilda was the first person who would know. She got up finally, and came into the kitchen where she stopped upon seeing me. She looked to her mother and could see on her face that something had happened. She didn’t seem surprised, but knowing her own grief was nothing compared to what her mother was going through, took a step forward and held her. My sister and niece stayed like that as I listened to the clock tick. My sister left my niece there with me as she went to the bathroom to compose herself.</p>
<p>“Matilda”</p>
<p>“Uncle Frank?”</p>
<p>“I need to ask you a serious question.”</p>
<p>“How do you get the memory out of one of these things?” I opened the box and Toki stood up.</p>
<p>“You brought that here? Get it out.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. You have to help me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not helping you with that. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s the devil, but it’s got… it’s got a lot of Pop Pop’s memory on there and I want to get it off.”</p>
<p>“Well you can’t just plug it in. Those things don’t do that. It’s a <a href="/item10">Calico</a> <a href="/item10"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> thing.”</p>
<p>“Calico. The drug company.”</p>
<p>“it’s recording everything we are saying and doing. Frank. Put it away. I can’t help you. And I’m not talking to you in front of it. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“Wait.” I grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into the side hallway. “You have to help me get this memory out of its head. It’s got Pop Pop in there. The last 15 years. It played it for me.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean it played it for you?”</p>
<p>“Light shot out of its eyes and it played the memory back for me. But it can’t do it again. Says it’s trapped inside the bunny’s brain. Not the pilot. You’ve got to know something about this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not uncommon. Those things are evil. They enslave the bunny, and take it over. You think it’s a bunny but it’s not. There have been cases, though, of the bunny keeping memories, and interrupting the system, the pilot. Listen. How bad do you want the memory off that bunny?”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad, like you’d pay someone to get the memory off?”</p>
<p>“I’m not paying you. You’re my niece.”</p>
<p>“Not me. But I know someone.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“I’m not speaking with that thing in the house.”</p>
<p>“Yes, fine. Let’s just do it. I have to return the damn thing.”</p>
<p>“Alright. You want to see how it’s done?”</p>
<p>“How what’s done?”</p>
<p>“How to keep that devil spy from intercepting my message?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care… yes… show me”</p>
<p>She left, and returned from her room with a small, black phone. This is an encrypted phone. It’s time you learnt how this works. Go ahead. Send.</p>

	<p>The sun was coming down heavy now. It was present. A constant reminder that this day would not stop, would not pause, would not go any other way but forward. I wanted to pause it, to hold time in a vice and get my bearings but it doesn’t work that way. The river goes where the river goes. When you’re in it, you go where the river goes. I thought of holding the waters back, finding an eddy to where I could catch my breath and plan. It was right there in front of me. The memory. That frail and fragile creature, gatekeeper to lost time, was a heartbeat away from extinction. Now, with Matilda in the picture, it made things more complex, I could only hope that we weren’t heading into a disaster. She was making plans with people I didn’t know, about something I couldn’t comprehend, that held the key to something I’d missed. One by one, the questions came. They couldn’t be tamed by the sunlight, or calmed with words. They were ever present.</p>
<p>I don’t like questions. They’re the kind of thing I try to avoid. I try to answer questions, at least to the people that need to be buying. I try to eliminate questions, to make it all seem okay. And usually it is. The questions are the things that get me down. I want to turn questions into emotion, angst into reassurance. And, now. I had none. I wanted to be able to leap from my own skin, rise above the room, fly out from where we were, from this little apartment, pull apart the day and put the pieces back together my way. (asop rock)</p>
<p>“Here. We go here.” Matilda returned with a hand drawn set of instructions. We were to go meet someone.</p>
<p>“We? Now?”</p>
<p>“Do you want it or not?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. We’ve just got to have a good lie to tell your mother.” Lies, are better than when they’re wrapped in truth. I’d just be dropping her off on my way out. She bought it. We embraced.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the coffee and pastries.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to head to the hospital to take care of everything. Will you be there?”</p>
<p>“After I take care of this little guy. George will be there. Will you be alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It just happened too quick.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be there later, just call.”</p>
<p>I stuffed the bunny in the box and we headed to the elevators.</p>
<p>“There’s no guarantee you know.” Matilda was trying to reassure me.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Do you…” She cut me off. She wouldn’t speak anymore in front of the bunny.</p>
<p>The light hurt my eyes, and the sleeplessness was starting to sink in, mixed with coffee, that strange sense of timelessness, of being on a different clock. The world moved around, and I started to feel like I was in that eddy after all. It was autopilot from there. The train. The transfers, waiting. We stopped and got food for the bunny. Rabbit food, plus some extra protein powder to keep his little brain functioning properly.</p>
<pre>
<code>We got off down where the markets were, busy, bustling, crowded. The market was hot, the smell of cumin and curry, fried dumplings and spice. He’d be there. I couldn’t talk to her. She went ahead, pushing her way through the crowd, leading us left, right, under canopies. I couldn’t talk to her through all the nose and chaos nor would she let me If I tried. I noticed her for the first time. She was smart. From what my sister told me, she did well in school, but it was her other life that got her into trouble. She was partly an activist. Fighting against… well, against me really… against what I did. And I was starting not to</code>

<p>Now, I’m not a fan of animals. I had a gerbil growing up that would gnaw the fingers off the action figures I placed in his cage. That was years ago and I was a child. This useless little creature was accountable for nothing. It wasn’t a dog that could fetch and roll over. It was a bunny. Bunny’s are nervous, timid creatures that don’t really offer the world anything other than a meditative stroke across its back. What’s so fun about feeding something carrots? What’s so fun about a thing that is just cute for cute sake? Nothing. Nothing at all. So why did he want a bunny? Why did he trade his family for this little piece of shit? I guess it was his old age. He’s had it for years. Had it since we had our fight. Had it since he started getting lonely. But it was just the bunny that he needed. I guess he needed that damn bunny more than he needed a family. He’d literally replaced us, with that. Why? Who knows. Well, one thing was for sure. It’s little brain in there, that pilot controlling his thoughts and actions, that was the thing that replaced us. This new line of half biological, half artificial assistants always creeped me the fuck out. Live animals with artificial intelligence built in? I didn’t get it. Give me a dog any day. Really. Give me a dog, it was time I invested in some all natural life around here. I advertised the damn things, but I didn’t get it. I was good at selling them. It was like taking candy from a baby. So simple. Pictures of smiling, happy people holding up these little animals to the sun. What a better, brighter day. Less lonely, with a just a hint of the rising overlord take-over. And now, watching my father slip away, this little fuck has to chime in and tell me time ask how I’m doing? I’ll tell you how I’m doing. I watching my family slip away and you, the only one he spent time with, you are</p>
<p>now making small, wanting to know all about me and tell me the history of this building. This little piece of shit needs to go to sensitivity training. Where is the off button?</p>
<p>“Nurse. Can we do something with this bunny?” I was sure there was a broom closet somewhere that we could stash him. Hell, give me a trash compactor.</p>
<p>“Mr. Stevens, he belongs to your father. I don’t have a say as to what happens to him.”</p>
<p>“Well who does?”</p>
<p>“In all honesty, he’s yours now. Yours or your sisters’.” Mine or my sisters? Sister, definitely.</p>
<p>“Alright. Thank you miss.” This was not alright.</p>
<p>The bunny sat on the chair next to me as I watched my father’s vitals.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” I asked the bunny.</p>
<p>“Toki. But Steven called me Brother.”</p>
<p>“I’m calling you Toki.”</p>
<p>“Alright Frank.”</p>
<p>“Just sit there please. Give me some peace, will you? No more chatting. I’ve got to go talk to my sister.”</p>
<p>“Alright Frank”</p>
<p>There was no way I was keeping it. It would end up a stew. How do you make bunny stew?</p>
<p>“Sister, I got to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“What is it Frank?”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to take that bunny.”</p>
<p>“I’d love to Frank but George is allergic.” At this point it was clear to me, that no amount of arguing was going to help. Once she’d made up her mind, it was over. George… always ruining everything. “And plus, Matilda has already asked me to keep that thing away from her.”</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="4">
<p>“Matilda?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. She’s against them.”</p>
<p>“Matilda. Well, I can’t blame her, but if that thing ends up as a pair of slippers for your next birthday don’t say I didn’t warn you.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t worry about it Frank. You’ll have to return it to the insurance agency anyhow. It’s theirs technically.”</p>
<p>“Can’t they take it now?”</p>
<p>“Well. Not until… not until he goes.” She looked down. It was not the time… “I just don’t understand where he went to all these years.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t getting any better, but he wasn’t getting any worse.</p>
<p>“We should go.” My sister didn’t have much patience for him any more.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>We called it for the night around midnight and I headed home.</p>
<p>“Do you have a box or something for the bunny?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Steven must have taken him to the theater in this.” The nurse handed me an old shoebox with holes cut into it.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” I turned to the bunny, who sat intently by the wall. “So, what, you just get in the box now? Here bunny. Here bunny.”</p>
<p>“My name is Toki.” He hopped to my feet and lifted up on two legs. I reached down for him, lifted him to my eyes and took a good look. What the hell was going on in there? I packed him up took him home, and laid a towel in the box so he’d have somewhere to sleep.</p>
<p>“You alright here?”</p>
<p>“Other than a little hungry, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“I have to feed you?”</p>
<p>“Vegetables always work. I require some extra nutrition to keep my functioning properly, but we can discuss that in the morning. You seem tired.”</p>
<p>I seem tired? “What about this?” I offered him some uncooked Brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>“This will do for now. I’m sorry for what’s happening with your father. It’s a terrible thing. I tried to keep him healthy, to keep him going, but there were some habits that he never gave up.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention him.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Of course”</p>
<p>“Are you alright out here? Can I just leave you to wander around or do I need to lock you in the bathroom or something?”</p>
<p>“Out here is fine. I can control myself.”</p>
<p>“And you won’t sh… you won’t… defecate on the rug?”</p>
<p>“I can use the toilet. It’s the door on the way in correct? Just make sure it’s ajar and I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“It’s good. Whatever you say. Goodnight bunny.” How long could this last?</p>
<p>I barely slept. The years snuck back in, posed as feverish nightmare, relentless. Every time I’d start to drift, they’d be there, over and over. Darkness eventually turned to wandering shadows as the light from the morning crept across the room. I was awakened by a phonecall around 6:30. It was my sister. He had passed in the night. Just like that. We</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="5">
<p>should have stayed. We should have been there. And there it was. It finally hit me. Overwhelmed and exhausted, I wept, and stared at the ceiling. I was orphaned, again. The second time he disappeared. This time, for good.</p>
<p>“Is everything alright?” it was the god damn bunny at the door.</p>
<p>“Toki. You can look shit up right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Frank. Of course. What would you like?”</p>
<p>“A recipe for rabbit stew.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing Frank. Would you like me to order you the ingredients?”</p>
<p>“Everything but the rabbit.”</p>
<p>“I sense your sarcasm, Frank. You don’t really want rabbit stew do you?”</p>
<p>“You really are a modern marvel. Just contact your maker, or whoever it is and let them know you can go home. “</p>
<p>“They already know, Frank”</p>
<p>“They knew, and I knew the minute he passed”</p>
<p>“You what?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Frank. I didn’t think you’d want to hear it from me. I take it you don’t like me very much.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, I don’t. When are they coming?”</p>
<p>“They’ll be here between 8 am and 4 pm.”</p>
<p>“And I’m supposed to stay here all day?”</p>
<p>“I can let them if you’d like. You don’t have to be here. I just don’t want to be left outside. I might be stolen, or made into soup.”</p>
<p>“Whatever works. I’m going to take a bath. Let me know if you’ve got any more exciting news.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Frank.”</p>
<p>I bathed, and tried to keep my heart from pounding through my chest. I laid in silence as the memories came back. Every time I’d close my eyes, there he was. Over and over. A flood of images, words, the sound of his voice. It was all there. Over and over. So I laid, and just watched it play. I wept. And in between the soft sounds of faucet dripping, I’d hear the bunny. That little prick was the last one to know anything that happened, and now he’s here. What happens if you don’t return him?</p>
<p>“Bunny, come here.” He hopped to the door.</p>
<p>“Yes, Frank?”</p>
<p>“What happens if I don’t return you?”</p>
<p>“You are fined, or go to jail.”</p>
<p>“How much? How long?”</p>
<p>“1.2 Million dollars, or 12 years.”</p>
<p>“Thank you bunny.”</p>
<p>Mother, Fucker. You know, for the piece of shit he is, he's actually kind of cute, i'll give him that. But I can't wrap my head around where the bunny stops and the artificial starts. You just kind of forget. I actually feel bad for the bunny that’s trapped in there with that brain… a puppet… a host. Whatever it is. Where does the bunny go when the pilot takes over?. I can't tell if the bunny is stuck inside the machine, or the machine is stuck inside the bunny. It's one of them questions that just goes in circles... the snake that ate itself I guess. It’s</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="6">
<p>enough to give me a headache. I lay back again, and watched the movie play. Well, it wasn’t much use being lonely. At least the bunny was here.</p>
<p>“Bunny!”</p>
<p>“Yes Frank?” The door to the bathroom was cracked open and he stuck his little face in.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, what have you gotten yourself into out there?</p>
<p>“Oh. I'm using my imagination. “</p>
<p>“Your imagination?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That's when things come to your mind from somewhere you can't distinctly control right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that and picturing a harem of naked of women.“</p>
<p>“Why would I do that?”</p>
<p>“You wouldn't. Well, carry on. I'll be out of here in a few minutes. Just finishing my beauty soak.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Frank.”</p>
<p>The bunny took off into the living room. I just wanted to stay in here for a bit a while longer. The warm water felt nice... got my blood flowing. I pulled the stopper from the drain and the water gurgled as it spit down the pipe, as I heard a crash in the living room.</p>
<p>“Bunny” No answer.</p>
<p>“Hey. Bunny. Toki. Toki? Everything okay? Toki?” I grabbed a towel and dried myself off. Did he just take a nosedive off the couch? Was it too much for him? I hope he wasn’t pissed at me. I’d have to chalk up a whole lotta dough if he did anything to himself. He wasn’t hurt though, he was furiously building, laying down pens on the floor. He’d knocked them off the desk to build with…</p>
<p>“Toki? Hey.” He didn't respond... just seemed to be in a trance or something. I knelt down and touched his back. “Toki?” He jumped.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry Frank. I don't know what happened. I don't know where time went. This is strange.”</p>
<p>“Did you make this?”</p>
<p>“Make what?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean what? All of this shit?”</p>
<p>“I don't know. I guess so... “</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“It looks like a map of… nevermind.”</p>
<p>“A map of what?”</p>
<p>“It’s Steven’ home.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I saw you, and he. You were fighting. I can’t remember. I can’t see it all.</p>
<p>“What can you see?”</p>
<p>And then it played. His eyes lit up and shown bright on the wall. I saw the scene, the day I fought with Steven. The bunny was watching. I watched through his eyes as we argued. I watched as I smashed a picture off the wall. I watched as I stormed out. I watched as he yelled behind me as he slammed the door. Then I watched his anger turn to sadness. I watched him slide to the ground and take the bunny into his arms. I watched him pick the frame from the floor, and put it back up on the wall. It didn’t make sense. He was angry, </p>

<p>telling me I was worthless two minutes ago, and here, here he was doing just the opposite. And the light faded.</p>
<p>“What else is there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Frank”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“That memory, I don’t know where it is.”</p>
<p>“The fuck are you talking about? Find, the memory. Search for the damn memory!”</p>
<p>“It’s not in the memory of the pilot.”</p>
<p>“Play it again. Play it again!”</p>
<p>“I’m trying but I can’t. I don’t know where it came from. It was in my imagination.”</p>
<p>“Listen. Toki. Bunny. That thing you just did. Do it again.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to say. I can’t.”</p>
<p>No? He can’t play it again? There was only one person I knew who knew anything about this stuff. Matilda.</p>
<p>I called my sister. They were home. I put the bunny in his box and we made our way to their place, subway line by subway line. (cameras) I picked up some pastries and coffee before going in. Didn’t want to be too suspicious. It was still early. She wasn’t up. My sister hadn’t told her. We sat at the kitchen table, ate and drank, tried not to lose it completely. There was too much going on right now. I wanted to explode. To rip the head clean off the bunny, roll it across the table to my sister and say ‘Here. It’s the last place he exists.’ But that would have ruined breakfast. There was no way this little bunny didn’t know what it had shown me. There’s no way that it didn’t know what was going on in its own brain. Matilda was the first person who would know. She got up finally, and came into the kitchen where she stopped upon seeing me. She looked to her mother and could see on her face that something had happened. She didn’t seem surprised, but knowing her own grief was nothing compared to what her mother was going through, took a step forward and held her. My sister and niece stayed like that as I listened to the clock tick. My sister left my niece there with me as she went to the bathroom to compose herself.</p>
<p>“Matilda”</p>
<p>“Uncle Frank?”</p>
<p>“I need to ask you a serious question.”</p>
<p>“How do you get the memory out of one of these things?” I opened the box and Toki stood up.</p>
<p>“You brought that here? Get it out.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. You have to help me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not helping you with that. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s the devil, but it’s got… it’s got a lot of Pop Pop’s memory on there and I want to get it off.”</p>
<p>“Well you can’t just plug it in. Those things don’t do that. It’s a Calico <a href="/item10"><img src="/static/img/bunny_icon.png" alt="add" height="12"></a> thing.”</p>
<p>“Calico. The drug company.”</p>
<p>“it’s recording everything we are saying and doing. Frank. Put it away. I can’t help you. And I’m not talking to you in front of it. It’s the devil.”</p>
<p>“Wait.” I grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into the side hallway. “You have to help me get this memory out of its head. It’s got Pop Pop in there. The last 15 years. It played it for me.”</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="8">
<p>“What do you mean it played it for you?”</p>
<p>“Light shot out of its eyes and it played the memory back for me. But it can’t do it again. Says it’s trapped inside the bunny’s brain. Not the pilot. You’ve got to know something about this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not uncommon. Those things are evil. They enslave the bunny, and take it over. You think it’s a bunny but it’s not. There have been cases, though, of the bunny keeping memories, and interrupting the system, the pilot. Listen. How bad do you want the memory off that bunny?”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad, like you’d pay someone to get the memory off?”</p>
<p>“I’m not paying you. You’re my niece.”</p>
<p>“Not me. But I know someone.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“I’m not speaking with that thing in the house.”</p>
<p>“Yes, fine. Let’s just do it. I have to return the damn thing.”</p>
<p>“Alright. You want to see how it’s done?”</p>
<p>“How what’s done?”</p>
<p>“How to keep that devil spy from intercepting my message?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care… yes… show me”</p>
<p>She left, and returned from her room with a small, black phone. This is an encrypted phone. It’s time you learnt how this works. Go ahead. Send.</p>

<p>PART II</p>
<p>Wool Over the Eyes</p>
<p>The sun was coming down heavy now. It was present. A constant reminder that this day would not stop, would not pause, would not go any other way but forward. I wanted to pause it, to hold time in a vice and get my bearings but it doesn’t work that way. The river goes where the river goes. When you’re in it, you go where the river goes. I thought of holding the waters back, finding an eddy to where I could catch my breath and plan. It was right there in front of me. The memory. That frail and fragile creature, gatekeeper to lost time, was a heartbeat away from extinction. Now, with Matilda in the picture, it made things more complex, I could only hope that we weren’t heading into a disaster. She was making plans with people I didn’t know, about something I couldn’t comprehend, that held the key to something I’d missed. One by one, the questions came. They couldn’t be tamed by the sunlight, or calmed with words. They were ever present.</p>
<p>I don’t like questions. They’re the kind of thing I try to avoid. I try to answer questions, at least to the people that need to be buying. I try to eliminate questions, to make it all seem okay. And usually it is. The questions are the things that get me down. I want to turn questions into emotion, angst into reassurance. And, now. I had none. I wanted to be able to leap from my own skin, rise above the room, fly out from where we were, from this little apartment, pull apart the day and put the pieces back together my way. (asop rock)</p>
<p>“Here. We go here.” Matilda returned with a hand drawn set of instructions. We were to go meet someone.</p>
<p>“We? Now?”</p>
<p>“Do you want it or not?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. We’ve just got to have a good lie to tell your mother.” Lies, are better than when they’re wrapped in truth. I’d just be dropping her off on my way out. She bought it. We embraced.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the coffee and pastries.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to head to the hospital to take care of everything. Will you be there?”</p>
<p>“After I take care of this little guy. George will be there. Will you be alright?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It just happened too quick.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be there later, just call.”</p>
<p>I stuffed the bunny in the box and we headed to the elevators.</p>
<p>“There’s no guarantee you know.” Matilda was trying to reassure me.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Do you…” She cut me off. She wouldn’t speak anymore in front of the bunny.</p>
<p>The light hurt my eyes, and the sleeplessness was starting to sink in, mixed with coffee, that strange sense of timelessness, of being on a different clock. The world moved around, and I started to feel like I was in that eddy after all. It was autopilot from there. The train. The transfers, waiting. We stopped and got food for the bunny. Rabbit food, plus some extra protein powder to keep his little brain functioning properly.</p>

<p>We got off down where the markets were, busy, bustling, crowded. The market was hot, the smell of cumin and curry, fried dumplings and spice. He’d be there. I couldn’t talk to her. She went ahead, pushing her way through the crowd, leading us left, right, under canopies. I couldn’t talk to her through all the nose and chaos nor would she let me If I </p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="10">
<p>tried. I noticed her for the first time. She was smart. From what my sister told me, she did well in school, but it was her other life that got her into trouble. She was partly an activist. Fighting against… well, against me really… against what I did. And I was starting not to blame her. She didn’t like all the technology… I mean, she did, apparently, but not all of it. There was something about her distrust of me, the bunny, and this city that got her into trouble, arguments at school. She started to sink away. She had her own secret world behind the walls of that house… and outside the walls of the house no less. The coloring in her hair was a hint at normalcy, but was it real? I got the sense that it was an act. She seemed to feign interest in pop culture to stay under the radar, but it was that hidden side that made her tick. What I did for a living was take everything she believed to be wrong about the world, wrap it in a pinstriped suit and send it into the boardrooms to be auctioned off as social propaganda. I didn’t know why she was helping me with this. Perhaps she wanted to know just as much as I did. Perhaps she liked the thrill of stealing a piece of million dollar equipment to give to some shady character she bought drugs from or did drugs with… I could see the two of them smoking opium together to kill the pain of an oppressive society, outsiders with nowhere to go and no one who’d listen to them. I don’t know if that’s true, but she was living in a different world and it was painfully obvious.</p>
<p>“We’re near. Wait here.”</p>
<p>That was all she spoke to me. I watched her black jacked disappear into the crowd as I stood like a fool in the rain, with the crowd sliding past me, a stake in the middle of a swarm of humans. The noise from the street, the conversations, they were too much. Fractions of conversations. Snippets of peoples lives, like tuning a radio. They all wandered around. They wandered, shopped, and spent their Saturday morning in one of the busiest places on earth. You could get almost anything here. The arched ceiling rose in the portico high above us, as the light poured in through the colonnades. The market was a labyrinth of stalls and crevices, racks, displays and talking walls, creating a collage of sights and sounds, real and immaterial. I lost her. I was lost here. Wandering in the creation of my own doing. I heard voices in my ears, saw my name and eyes looking directly at me. The more I stood still, the more the eyes began to turn on me. The crowd brushed past in every direction, stirring, and churning this human soup. And the more I stood there, the more things seemed to make sense to me. The walls took me back to Puerto Rico, back to Venice and that sleepy little side street off Rue Mouffetard, where I spent a week the dark haired girl navigating the clubs and cafes. And they knew. There I was, my life on the walls. Standing here, I was bombarded with reminders of the years I’d spent wandering. There was nothing I wanted more than to just get that god damn memory out of the bunny and the walls were trying to speak to me. They were trying to teach me a lesson. Be my friend, be my enemy. Who knew? They wanted me to be something, to be someone. To do something… but all I wanted was this bunny to give up his shit so I could go home, take a bath and rub one out while I still had the energy. I didn’t want to see my sister at the hospital. I didn’t want to have to deal with his body, the arrangements… he should have taken care of it himself. I’m pretty sure he did. He knew it was coming. One thing was for sure, he wasn’t dumb. Which made it even worse. You know, if he was senile… maybe it would have made it better. If he didn’t know what was happening. I hear that rarely happens anymore. There’s so much they can do for that now… but what’s the use. You just go, and you know it. Let me go off into my own head, give me the freedom of ignorance when my time comes and I’ll be </p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="11">
<p>happy, but they just keep squeezing in more years, and squeezing out more dollars for every year you’re left here. It began to make sense. Matilda seemed to make sense. God damn sense. Fuck her. Just find your little friend and lets get out of here. The walls began to close in. The acrid smell of human sweat mixed with perfume seemed to be coming from all over. I began to anxious as the walls began to show me more. They showed me happy thoughts, could sense my anxiety, they could sense my agitation and began to shift. I know what they were doing. I told someone to make them do it. And here I was… hating every minute of it. The high ceilings seemed to be a mile away, and no way to get out. The colonnade became bars… I could barely make out the light from outside. My eyes had adjusted the dim colors here… and the walls began to speak again. I saw the girl, the dark haired one from Paris. Time slowed and she sparkled. Where’d they get that memory? Where’d they dig that out of? And there it was. She was standing behind words that read ‘Delta’. They’d stolen her image from my memory and used it to tell me to travel, to get away. Perhaps they knew I wanted to leave… and Matilda’s jacket made sense… that embroidered A… the anarchist. I’d just thought it ironic, but it started to resonate. I look around and I see this place, sparkling and crumbling. A beautiful ruin. It's perfect. I can see the world that I’ve built. "You might have 15 new friends in the area... just wear red on Tuesday and say the magic word, 'Haberdashery' and you're part of something bigger!"... some social algorithm somewhere, or series of them... around every corner, in every thing...they're trying to dictate what life should be all about... they're trying to tell me where to go, who to meet, what to do, what to see, what I might like to read, what I might like to know, what I might like to think, and what I might like to buy. You know what these sort of consumer prediction machines might recommend I buy? A fuck-off machine. It's the technological equivalent of being a pop Idol and having a personal bodyguard... they don't just protect you, they don't just create a barrier, they are actively aggressive so that all other parties back down. Brute and with a callous neglect of human dignity. With them, you have that power to push back against a sea of troubles... Help me Fuck - off machine. Help me forward all recommendations to burn for eternity in the fires of Hades. Every recommendation, every targeted add... anyone looking to know what it is I'm doing is a DDOS in the face of sanity. I don't care. I don't need It. I've had my time, and it has left me to my vices... left me for my vices... Time ran away with the good half and left me with sloppy seconds... Who knows, maybe the second course will be better. So those guys, the ones trying to figure all my shit out, trying to tell me who I'm supposed to be through the process of guessing what type of person I might like to become... that's what it's really about isn't it? Who do you want to become? You're not good enough. You need to meet more people, do more things, become more interesting, become smarter, better looking, have more friends, have better friends, have less enemies, have more life experience under your belt... We can help... We're going to get you more money, more happiness, and you're either going to start fucking your girlfriend more because of your new found confidence, or your going to start cheating on your wife because you will realize for the first time in your life, someone other than the person you fell in love with for the sole fact that she loved you unconditionally, might love you just as much and be twice as frisky in the sack. And we can help. All you need to do is buy our shit. It's about this time, you find yourself relaxing, supine, on a park bench, and the words roll out. "Dear Amazon. It has come to my attention that your aggressive attitude towards my own behavior, dependent upon my past</p>

<div class="page" data-page="11">
<p>decisions, are assumed to be for my best interest. It isn't for a lack of gratitude upon which your gesture brings me great pain, but rather a perceived lack of trust that I hold within myself the ability to rise or fall, fail or conquer. That my own life isn't just the amalgamation of suggested experiences, or a buffet to which I pick-and-choose to taste, but a hunt for fresh meat, warm, bloody, and satisfying. I do not need to be satiated. Let me starve. I do not need to be clothed. Let me freeze. And I know your dark secrets. Do not pretend that your offerings do not come at a price. I reject it. Do not offer me the slavery of others. I reject them. I will take your soul for offering me the souls of others. I will spill your blood for offering me the blood of others. I am not bluffing. I have nothing to lose. We are all guilty and redemption is a myth."</p>
<p>I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was her. Without speaking she handed me a box and motioned for me to place the bunny in that box. The box was heavy, covered in some sort of metallic fabric. I placed the bunny box inside.</p>
<p>She spoke. “Phone and wallet” and waited with her hand held out. I handed them over.</p>
<p>“No shopping sprees.” She didn’t look amused. “What’s this all about?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, and turned to go. I followed. My memories waved goodbye as we headed from the Bazzar to the street, and stopped at an old gas powered car. She opened the door, grabbed the box out of my hands, tossed it in and slammed the door. She started to walk away, looking around nervously and I followed. We finally turned the corner and again I asked “Will you tell me what all this is about?”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to be somewhere public. I know it doesn’t make sense, but it actually works. You duplicate yourself, impersonate yourself and you can move around freely. It’s what he’s doing.”</p>
<p>“You’re contact?”</p>
<p>“My boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“All this so you can have a makeout session with your bf without the bunny spying on you?”</p>
<p>“All this so the bunny doesn’t know who we’re meeting.”</p>
<p>“So you don’t want anyone to know you’re dating this dude because he that ugly?”</p>
<p>“Because it would make things unsafe if the two were connected, if the bunny could somehow know what he knew. It’s a risk. I’m surprised he agreed to it. But maybe curiosity got the better of him.”</p>
<p>We turned another corner and ducked into a massage parlor.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is the time for aroma therapy Mati.”</p>
<p>“It’s a private residence. No cameras.” We turned the corner and I followed her down a long hall of doors until we stopped near the end. “Wait here” She entered, and came out a few seconds later. “You’re clean”.</p>
<p>“Clean?”</p>
<p>“Not transmitting. It’s okay. You can relax. This is just an extra precaution. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows and opened the door. I don’t know what I was expecting. Some tattood hulk with a leather jacket and a bat ready to bash my skull in, or some wigged out junky, too cranked off his ass to complete sentences. But he was just… normal. Skinny guy, with a white t-shirt and jeans. Nothing out of the ordinary. You might find 100’s of him walking the streets of the bazzar right now.</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="12">
<p>“I’m Omer.”</p>
<p>“Frank.”</p>
<p>“Matilda has told me all about you and your problem.”</p>
<p>“That’s funny, she’s told me nothing about you.” I looked at her with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Sorry about that, but your problem is a problem for a lot of people… and if it were here, it’d be a problem for us too.”</p>
<p>“I just want the damn memory out of that bunny.”</p>
<p>“Me too. It’s not everyday someone steals an ABA. Those things are worth a lot of money.”</p>
<p>“And what’s it worth to you?”</p>
<p>“Just never had my hands on one I guess. But there is just one question. How badly do you want that memory?”</p>
<p>“Pretty bad.”</p>
<p>“I have some good news and some bad news.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead. The good news is that we can get the memory and I know where we can do it.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Now the bad.”</p>
<p>“The bad news is that it’s not an easy thing to do, and we need to do some traveling to get the memory back.”</p>
<p>“How long? How far? I’m supposed to be done with him today?”</p>
<p>“Then you’re out of luck.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“it’s a full days drive, non-stop, maybe less if we take high speed, and then the time for surgery.”</p>
<p>“Surgery? What is this?”</p>
<p>“The ‘B’ in ABA, stands for Biological. Do you see any ports in its head? Have you tried connecting wirelessly? It’s all locked down. If you want to get the memory back, we’re going to need to do surgery. And once we’re in, it’s not as simple as just going in there and copying files. It’s in the bunny’s brain, not the artificial. I’ve only read about this happening. I’ve only read about this sort of thing on deep web blogs. I wanted to see it for myself.”</p>
<p>“So what are we supposed to do? I can’t give it back yet. Fuck.”</p>
<p>“It’s your call. You go missing for a few days, steal the bunny for a bit, take him in for surgery and give him back at the end. You’ll be questioned, you’ll be interrogated, you’ll be fined, possibly do a few days in jail, but you’ll have your memory. How much is it worth to you?.”</p>
<p>I was going to smash this little fuck’s brain in. Drags me all the way out here just to tell me its impossible. Not impossible, just ridiculous.</p>
<p>“No. I can’t do it. Those memories should be mine. Damnit. They don’t own them. Fuck.”</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door, and we went silent. Matilda cracked the door to find out who it was and the owner stepped in.</p>
<p>“Omer, you have a phone call.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Just a second.”</p>
<p>He left, and I was stuck there in the room with my niece.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Frank. He didn’t tell me it would be like this. I just wanted to give you a chance.”</p>
<p>“Some chance. It’s alright. I think we’ll just go home. Its been too much excitement for one day.”</p>
<p>Omer returned, hurried, and nervous.</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="13">
<p>“Frank. Matilda. It’s time to go.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we were just deciding to put it to bed.”</p>
<p>“No. I mean, it’s time to leave the city.”</p>
<p>“The city? No. It’s time to go home.”</p>
<p>“The Auditors know you’re here. They’ve accused you of stealing the bunny. Apparently it’s not just the insurance agency who wants it.”</p>
<p>“The Auditors? How can you be sure?”</p>
<p>“Someone has to watch the watchers.”</p>
<p>“Can’t I just turn myself in, say it was a misunderstanding? I’m sure it’s fine. No one has complained. We haven’t done anything wrong.”</p>
<p>“It’s too late. Someone wants that bunny, someone wants you, and someone wants us. They know about the two of you, they don’t know about me yet, but I’m sure it’ll happen eventually.”</p>
<p>“This is crazy, we’ve done nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>“But we were planning to, and somehow they figured it out.”</p>
<p>“So now we’re fugitives?”</p>
<p>“Now YOU’RE a fugitive. She’s an accomplice, and I’ll be one soon.”</p>
<p>“Frank. He’s right. We’ve got to go. These people aren’t the people to mess with. They will with you what they want to do with you. There is no tolerance. If they say you are wanted, you are wanted. We are wanted.”</p>
<p>“We are wanted? We are wanted? All I ever wanted was that god damn bunny’s dreams… and look at this. No, there’s got to be another way.”</p>
<p>“Right now, there’s the back door.”</p>
<p>“She’s right.”</p>
<p>“Until we find a better way, we’re fugitives.”</p>
<p>“Just like that?”</p>
<p>“Just like that.”</p>
<p>“I should have never listened to you.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have listened to me? I shouldn’t have listened to you! You’re the one so determined to see that bunny give up his shit. Dude, face it. The past is the past… now our future’s fucked.”</p>
<p>“So what do we do? Well, we can lay low for a while until they catch us and rot in prison until we die… no, it’s probably not that bad. But here’s the thing. Now that we’re fugitives, lets just get the bunny’s dreams off there for you. You ready?”</p>
<p>“No. Not really. But fuck it.”</p>
<p>It looks like I mistook opportunity for misfortune, and it took the day and turned it to hell. My sister was going to kill me. I’d made a criminal out of her daughter in a matter of minutes… well, by the sound of it, she was probably already half way down the corridor of broken dreams dealing with some shady shit, so it was only a matter of time I guess… but it’s just not the sort of thing you want to do to blood.</p>
<p>Omer stepped forward. “The auditors are going to be here in a matter of minutes. It’s time to go. Maybe we can figure something out, claim it was an accident, claim ignorance. But we don’t know if we’re really being charged with any crime yet.”</p>
<p>“So you have a way out of here?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. We’ve got to go to the tunnels.”</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="14">
<p>It was the subway and train tunnels, the old, dark thoroughfares of subterranean transit.</p>
<p>“It’s not completely safe, but we can get to a few places, lose them. We’ll be picked back up when we get out of the tunnels so we’ll have to throw off our sent.”</p>
<p>Throw off our sent. It’s strange how quickly you can go from being a guy with a problem, to a guy who’s on some kind of secret list. I’d never be off that list. Once you’re on, you’re on for good.</p>
<p>Omer grabbed the bunny from the other room and we followed him down the corridor until the very end. We headed into a broom closet with an old grate floor.</p>
<p>“It’s in here. We have to go down.”</p>
<p>He pulled back a rubber mat and revealed a heavy steal door with an old circular combination lock on it.. He knew the combination, and preyed open the latch to reveal a staircase leading underground.</p>
<p>“This used to be a transit maintenance facility until this line got shut down after the floods. They moved the equipment but left the access. After you” It was dark, the only light came from the dull red glow from the emergency lights spaced out along the passage ways. I guess they left them on just in case. They hummed with electricity, sounding feeble and unsure, as if they could burst or fail at any moment. Omer shut the doors behind us and went up ahead. Matilda grabbed him by the hand and I followed behind. My jacket and tie weren’t used to being underground.</p>
<p>“Here, you take the bunny.” Omer handed me the bunny and box. “Don’t let him out of there or all this sneaking around will be in jest.</p>
<p>We walked along these small corridors until we came to the main tunnel. Omer seemed to know where he was going. He pulled a small light from his pocket once we reached the main tunnel. The red emergency lights had all but been forgotten and the tunnel empty and cold without them. Our footsteps echoed as the gravel under our feed slid, the dit sliding between our shoes and the concrete. Over trash, leaves, papers, reminents of when this place used to have life in it. We hurried. He seemed nervous. We’d come across trash that was new, days, or weeks old, and food scraps gnawed at by small rodents. There were people living down here. It took us about two miles of walking but there was finally a dash of light in the distance, casting slight shadows on the walls and ground beneath me. I could We stopped.</p>
<p>“Here’s where we have to change.”</p>
<p>Omer took a sharp turn down a small hallway on the left of the tunnel and stopped at an electrical box. He pulled a key from his pocket and unlocked the box, pulling old jackets and clothes for us to wear. “You’ll have to put these on to look different. There’s hats in here and a face mask to keep them off you. There’s cameras at the entrance.</p>
<p>You two leave from here. The three of us can’t be seen together.”</p>
<p>“Where will we meet you?” I asked.</p>
<p>He turned to Matilda, “You know where we met last? We can’t go to the studio, they’ll be watching it. Meet me at the bank. I’ll bring a mobile kit. They may still think you’re in the bazaar, and they don’t know I’m with you.”</p>
<p>We split up. Matilda and I exited the tunnel and Omer split off back into the darkness. “You know where we’re going?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s his place.”</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="15">
<p>“You sure we’ll be safe?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“It depends how bad they want you. I don’t know why they want it so bad… that bunny.” Seems like a waste of time and energy to me.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for doing this. I’m sorry I got you into it.”</p>
<p>“It would have happened eventually.”</p>
<p>There’s nothing that I could do or say to make her understand how much I wished she wasn’t a part of it. I guess she wasn’t. She didn’t steal the bunny. I did. But who knows what was going on behind the scenes, who was added to the database and in what capacity.</p>
<p>“Keep your head low and keep the mask on until we’re there.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“To the bank.”</p>
<p>You’d never know it, but the only places that seemed to be available to meet in the city, free of surveillance, were the uninhabited, the old, the broken down and forgotten places. If it’s known, it will be known to many. The forgotten, the underground, underappreciated and desolate places… those seemed to be the respite places for these two. There was a way about them, an unspoken language that kept them going. They rarely spoke to each other. It seemed to be through eye contact and glances that they passed any information at all. We walked and walked. I wanted to ask her questions, but I couldn’t. I was getting the sense that she didn’t talk openly about these things in public. We were hidden for the moment, unknown but suspicious blips. Two fake derelicts. With her, there was always paranoia. There was always suspicion. She didn’t know if we were being watched. She didn’t know that we were safe. There was no way to know, one way or the other. I suppose the only way to know is to intercept a message, to hear what they here, to see what they see. It was the problem with her. There was no way to prove or disprove any of this… but it could only be assumed that you were always at risk. You could only assume that there was someone out there with eyes on you, following you, listening to you, recording your footsteps, watching your movements, analyzing your actions, predicting what you might do next. I tried to predict peoples behaviors. It’s what I did for a living. I tried to predict what they were, who they were, who they wanted to be, and supplied them with the access to be able to do just that. It wasn’t just with my clien’ts products that I could get them to do things. It was their own memories, their own being that made them want to either stay the same, or change. It was the things that they loved about themselves, or wanted to change about themselves that we sought. And we could tell. We could tell when someone wanted a change, or was making a change. Their habits changed. That 95% accuracy changed. It would change every now and again, every few years with each person, with the changing tides of life… but these too were expected. The 7 year itch is a real thing, and we can predict when it’s coming. We can see by the language they use whether they’re happy or not in their relationships, in their jobs, in their lives. We know when someone will be looking for something different. And it isn’t surprising that there are new acquaintances made at these junctures as well. It depends, really, what type of person you are, if you’re going to be doing something different tomorrow than what you’re doing today. I guess I stopped following my own pattern today. I guess by dropping off the map, I’ve gone ahead and marked myself for more scrutiny. That’s where they are really interested. The part about following people, about knowing their habbits and trends… that’s boring. To people like me, who can look at a person, a </p>

<p>group of 10, 20, 100, 10,000 or 1,000,000 and tell what is going to happen with them, the prediction part is boring after a while. You just get good at it, and we have interns who can go through piles of data with sorting algorithms they’ve developed themselves and just tell us… up, down, left, right, red shoes on Tuesday, extra spicy in September. It’s just not too interesting. Once we know the data, once we know the trend it’s just a matter of keeping things going. It’s just a matter of keeping the shoppers shopping. But when there’s a change, when the trickle of shifts starts to happen and the first fluctuation marks a sea change, then we ‘ve got something to work with.</p>
<p>We arrived at the bank, and old building on the corner of forgotten and unused. A large chain and key lock held the doors shut, but she had the key. She didn’t look over her shoulder, just pushed through and led us inside as if it were second nature.</p>
<p>Once inside she turned and spoke. “Don’t touch anything.”</p>
<p>The place was grand, high ceilings, columns, a large grandfather clock placed high in the center of the rear wall, the windows boarded shut cast slivers of light across the floor. We walked through to the back, past the teller stations, and waited outside the vault on a plastic mat.</p>
<p>I tried to add a little levity to the situation. “It’s nice. Could use some dusting, but I like it.”</p>
<p>Matilda looked at me confused. Didn’t know if she thought it was funny, dumb, or just inappropriate. It was always hard to tell with her. “Thanks for doing this. I’m sorry you got dragged in like this. It might not be that bad.”</p>
<p>“It’s that bad. But we need to figure out why.”</p>
<p>“How can we do that?”</p>
<p>“The bunny should have some information. We’ll need to know more.”</p>
<p>I could only assume that she knew what she was talking about. She got a message from Omer and we waited in silence for him to arrive. The place echoed with each shuffle of the feet. I leaned back against the wall to relax for a minute. “I said don’t touch anything.” She glared at me.</p>
<p>“Whatever you say.”</p>
<p>We heard talking outside. She grabbed me and pulled me down below the teller’s desk. It grew louder as they came near the door. The cracks in the boards on the front door shuttered and the light flickered as bodies passed by. We waited. There wasn’t much we could do except wait in silence as the talking grew louder, muffled and unclear, but the door stayed shut, the lock remained. Matilda just sat, legs crossed, waiting calmly as if this was a regular occurrence. I tried to stay calm as I stayed silent focusing on the voices. Then, as quickly as they came they went. It was silent. We listened for signs of life outside the door but there was nothing. Minutes passed and we stayed huddled and silent. She was the first to move, lifting herself onto her feet as she looked, eyes fixed on the door. I stood up and watched. There was nothing, no movement, not noise… it seemed safe. “You do this often? Hiding and ducking into dark corners?”</p>
<p>“On occasion.”</p>
<p>“Does your mother know?”</p>
<p>“Do you think she knows? And if she did, do you think I’d ever be allowed outside the house?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’d freak out if she knew about all this.”</p>
<p>“What she doesn’t know won’t hurt her.”</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="17">
<p>“If you end up in jail, it will. I don’t know that she can handle losing a father and daughter in one weekend.”</p>
<p>“Really? You’re going to lecture me?</p>
<p>“Maybe you can go back. I’ll say I kidnapped you.”</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s not such a bad id…”</p>
<p>The chain rattled and the door swung open. We dropped down behind the counter again and listened. The door slammed shut and footsteps crossed the room to us. It was Omer. “You scared the shit out of us.” Matilda rose and hugged him.</p>
<p>“You two okay? I had to wait out there for a while. Some kind of drug deal right outside the door.”</p>
<p>“We’re fine. What do you need from us? From the bunny?”</p>
<p>He pulled three white painter’s suits from the duffle bag. “First, put these on. We can’t go leaving DNA around.” We changed on the plastic mat and he wrapped our coats and clothes in it, and headed into the vault. A card table and a few folding chairs sat at the center. Nothing else. He closed the door behind us. “This vault won’t let the ABA communicate. Now, lets see that bunny.” I pulled the bunny from the box and placed him on the table.</p>
<p>The bunny looked up, head cocked, and spoke. “Frank. I really don’t appreciate being stuffed in there this whole time. What are you up to?”.</p>
<p>“Just trying to find out all your mysteries.”</p>
<p>“My mysteries? Who is the other male?</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me.” Omer spoke to the bunny.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who you are, but that looks like Matilda. I recognize her from Steven’s pictures.”</p>
<p>“Well, I should have expected that.” Matilda looked to Omer for reassurance and he could only shrug his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’ve got something for you to wear.” Omer pulled out some black fabric and a collar from his bag, set them on the table and began to check his phone.</p>
<p>“He’s transmitting now, I’ve found his signal. Matilda, can you hold him for me?”</p>
<p>“What have you got there?” Again, Toki cocked his head inquisitively.</p>
<p>“This will be good for you. We won’t have to keep you in that box the whole time.” Matilda held him down as Omer placed the fabric over the bunny’s head and snapped it into place. It had cutouts for the ears, eyes, and mouth. “This collar will do as well.” He placed the collar around his neck, and checked his phone again. “Nothing. He’s not transmitting. The fabric and the collar disrupt the signal. He won’t be able to communicate anymore. You don’t have to stay in that dark little box anymore, okay?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, but I really need to be able to communicate. Could you please take them off?”</p>
<p>“Not for a while… They’re staying on.”</p>
<p>“Frank, would you take them off me. I’m not supposed to be wearing these.”</p>
<p>“Sorry buddy, they’re staying on.”</p>
<p>Omer leaned down to the bunny. “Now, Toki. You like to be called Toki?”</p>
<p>“Yes, unidentified male, you can call me Toki.”</p>
<p>“Call me Peter.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Peter.”</p>
<p>“Toki, I want you to replay back the memory that you showed Frank.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how.”</p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="18">
<p>“You don’t know how?”</p>
<p>“It’s in my imagination, and I don’t know how to get it.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember showing Frank the memory?”</p>
<p>“I remember showing him something, but I don’t know what I showed him.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember what it felt like when you were showing him the memory?”</p>
<p>“It felt strange, I was tired.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what I want you to do, is think of how you felt when you showed Frank that memory. I want you to try to get yourself back to that place.”</p>
<p>“Frank, would you like me to do this?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Toki. Please try.”</p>
<p>“Alright Frank”.</p>
<p>The bunny’s eyes began to look heavy, sleepy. Matilda and I looked to Omer as if he knew what was going on but he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’ve only read about this. I don’t really know how it works.”</p>
<p>The bunny began to relax, resting on his haunches, staying still, his eyes blinked, as he appeared to start to doze off. They were almost closed, he looked to be just on the cusp of sleep when they lit up. A scene appeared on the wall, it was my father, in his home, checking notes, writing, watching commercials, watching media. He’d go back and forth, writing notes on paper, watching the screen, taking notes about what he was seeing. We couldn’t see what was being written, but it was something. Omer started recording this with his phone. I watched a man I had come to lose, seem to lose himself in front of that screen. He was looking for something, waiting intently for clues on the screen. When he’d see one, he’d jot it down. It looked almost normal. He often wrote notes to himself. He was always writing something down, so this didn’t seem that out of the ordinary, but there was something about this, that just seemed a little bit off. He seemed to be waiting for something on the screen, like looking for clues.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I looked to Omer.</p>
<p>“Wait.” He watched the wall, the projection as if transfixed, he didn’t want to miss a moment.</p>
<p>We watched as my father wrote the notes but we couldn’t see what he was writing. Then, the bunny, played another, and another of just my father watching the screen, writing notes, decoding something. We couldn’t see what he was writing. We saw through Toki’s eyes, and Steven was keeping them hidden from the bunny, but he slipped up, dropped his pad and we could see for a moment. It was hard to make out what was written and as quickly as we could see, it was over. Light dimmed and Toki began to awake from his dream. Omer stopped recording.</p>
<p>For a moment, I got to see a glimpse of his life… a glimpse into what I’d been ostracized from… his life. There, on the walls of that vault, he lived again. As quickly as the light appeared, it was gone, and we were left with only questions.</p>
<p>“Do you still want me to try to find the memories?”</p>
<p>Matilda spoke “You haven’t found them yet?”</p>
<p>“No Matilda, I don’t know if I can.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t remember. There’s something else going on in there that the pilot doesn’t know about.”</p>
<p>Omer watched the screen of his phone and paused as my father dropped the pad… he </p>
</div>

<div class="page" data-page="19">
<p>signaled to Matilda and I and we left the vault, leaving Toki inside.</p>
<p>“I think you’re father may have been involved in something. Something he obviously didn’t want the bunny to know about.”</p>
<p>“Like what? He was an old man.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. He was writing numbers… some coded information, but whatever it is, it’s valuable.”</p>
<p>“You think that’s why we’ve been targeted?”</p>
<p>“I just don’t know, but it’s possible.”</p>
<p>“So now what?”</p>
<p>“The only way to know is to get the rest of the memory out of that bunny. We have to do it quickly, and we have to do it someplace safe. I can’t get us all the way there, but I can get us close. “</p>
<p>“You can get us close?”</p>
<p>“We’ll need to leave the city. We can take my car.”</p>
<p>We left the bank, and made our way on foot through the streets. We had… It was getting dark. I hadn’t checked my messages, or talked to my sister. I needed to get in touch with her, let her know I hadn’t kidnapped her daughter. Perhaps I had. There was room for misinterpretation. There was room for now for me to turn back, to head home and give the four legged fragmented memory of my father back to the rightful owners. I was at the point between anxious and exhausted, and rationalizing this journey took balancing the fear of consequence and justification through a bereaved act of temporary insanity. If I turned back now there might be the chance to save the girl, to hid the boy, and to just keep on </p>

<p>living. To plead my case to the auditors, fake a confession to the bunny itself in confidence, knowing it’d be used as evidence of my actions. But it was all being recorded. The bunny knew we kidnapped it, stuffed it in a box and forced him to play back the memory. There was no way around it. We stole the bunny, kidnapped the little guy in hopes of breaking into its subconscious to steal something of questionable value. It wasn’t questionable to me. It was the memory of someone I loved and had grown removed from. I was blood, not the bunny, not the auditors, not the ones who made and manufactured what went on inside its head. He was both a burden and a fundamental constituent of passage. At the end of this journey, then what? If we do get the memory from his head, if I do get what I want, what’s to come of Toki? At that point, we can’t go giving him back. The options seemed to be growing smaller by the second. So we walked. A kidnapper, two teens and a insubordinate hard drive shaped like a rabbit. I couldn’t imagine what was going on in my Sister’s head. Her daughter and brother had gone missing the day after her father passes. She had to know we were safe. Surely there was a way to contact her and let her know she didn’t need to worry. “Is there anyway we can contact your mother, tell her we’re alright?”</p>
<p>The two of them looked at each other. Omer exhaled as he thought. “If you’re worried about phone calls and being linked to us we can find another way. There might not be a simple way. Fuck, even a carrier pigeon would do. Something. Hand a kid on a bike a note, 20 bucks, and directions and tell him to deliver the damn thing.”</p>
<p>We got to Omer’s after dark and headed out. He had an old jeep, ran on gas and had little in the way of amenities. ‘Dumb Tech’ they called it.</p>
<p>As we drove, the radio played and we listened to the president speak. She was eloquent, young and in control of this place. Omer turned the radio up when she came on.</p>
